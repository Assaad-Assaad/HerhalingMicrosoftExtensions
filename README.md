# ðŸ”„ HerhalingMicrosoftExtensions

This project demonstrates the use of Dependency Injection, Configuration, and Logging in a .NET application using the `ApplicationHostBuilder`. It serves as a practical exercise to understand service lifetimes, logging configuration, and configuration binding.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

- Implements three services with different lifetimes:
  - **Service A**: Singleton â€” only one instance created during the runtime.
  - **Service B**: Scoped â€” created once per scope.
  - **Service C**: Transient â€” created every time it is requested.
- **Service A** is injected into **Service B** using Dependency Injection.
- Logging is configured with different log levels depending on the service namespace:
  - **Service A** logs at the **Trace** level.
  - All services in the project namespace log at **Debug** level.
  - Everything else logs at **Warning** level.
- Configuration is set up and bound to a custom configuration class, utilizing:
  - Environment variables
  - `appsettings.json`
- Demonstrates best practices with Microsoft Extensions for Dependency Injection, Logging, and Configuration.
